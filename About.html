  <h1>About Samala</h1>
  <p>Samala is a lifestyle brand that creates authentic apparel and accessories that are affordable, aesthetic, and also athletic. Our name derives from a Southern African language, Chichewa, meaning 'to protect and oversee.' In Hebrew, it also means 'requested of God.'</p>
  <p>As a brand, we are dedicated to giving back to the community. That's why we have committed to dedicating 10% of our profits to paying tuition for students in need. We believe that education is a fundamental right and that everyone should have access to it.</p>
  <p>Since our launch, Samala has provided tuition for ten students in Zimbabwe. We started in Zimbabwe because our founders are originally from Zimbabwe as well as the United States. However, we continuously strive to widen our influence across the world.</p>
