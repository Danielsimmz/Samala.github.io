Summary update
So this project is about a website that sells clothes and its based off a real website called samalausa.com that me and my friend started and I'm just making another website as a project for this class. So far there's three pages for the project : the homepage, collection page, and the about us page and I have managed to put images in the website for the background and the different clothing items. I have put in some buttons with functionality that takes you to the desired pages and I have put some good css styling for the navigation bar. The page is decently functional for the most part and you can toy around with it to see.
